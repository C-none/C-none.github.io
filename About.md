My name is Huzhiyuan Long(龙胡志远). My research interest is in computer graphics, mainly aimed at rendering. I am currently searching for a PhD position(2024 fall) in rendering. You can contact me by [email](javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('nbjmup;uftu');).

I have been mentored by Professor [Jia](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/jiajinyuan/) in [his lab](https://smart3d.tongji.edu.cn/en/Home.htm) during my undergraduate study(2021.12 - now). I initially assisted his graduate students in Web3D research. Driven by my passion for rendering, I later independently conducted a collaborative rendering project under his guidance, and eventually published our results in [CCF CAD/Graphics 2023](https://dmcv.sjtu.edu.cn/cadgraphics2023/).

I used to be interested in programming competitions and took part in the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/no2newbie) contest, where I achieved a rating of 1777(<font color=Blue>expert</font>) at my best.

## Interests

During my high school, I was fascinated by anime style videos made by [MMD](https://learnmmd.com/what-is-mikumikudance/)(MikuMikuDance) and wanted to make these virtual characters as vivid and real as possible. Therefore, I stepped into computer graphics at university. As I learned more about computer graphics, I gradually realized that simulating motion and light transport is the core of rendering photorealistic graphics. I finally chose rendering as my direction for further research.
