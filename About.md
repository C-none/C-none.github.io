My name is Huzhiyuan Long (龙胡志远). My research interest lies in computer graphics, with a primary focus on rendering. Please feel free to contact me via [email](javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('nbjmup;uftu');). Here is my [CV](/assets/ChineseCV/lhzy_resume.pdf).

 <!-- I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor [Jia](https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/info/1204/3256.htm) in [his lab](https://smart3d.tongji.edu.cn/en/Home.htm) during my undergraduate studies. Our results were eventually published in [CCF CAD/Graphics 2023](https://dmcv.sjtu.edu.cn/cadgraphics2023/).  -->

## News

I recently finished a real-time ray tracing [demo](https://c-none.github.io/Web-RTRT) based on WebGPU. Check this [blog](https://c-none.github.io/ray-tracing-on-WebGPU/) for details.

## Interests

During my high school years, I was fascinated by anime-style videos made with [MMD](https://learnmmd.com/what-is-mikumikudance/)(MikuMikuDance). I wanted to make these virtual characters as vivid and realistic as possible. This led me to delve into computer graphics at university. As I learned more about computer graphics, I gradually realized that physics simulation and light transport are the core of rendering photorealistic graphics. Consequently, I chose rendering as my direction for further research. -->
