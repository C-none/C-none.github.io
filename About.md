My name is Huzhiyuan Long (龙胡志远). My research interest lies in computer graphics, with a primary focus on rendering. I am currently seeking a PhD position for the Fall of 2024 in computer graphics. Please feel free to contact me via [email](javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('nbjmup;uftu');). Here is my [CV](/assets/cv/cv.pdf).

I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor [Jia](https://sse.tongji.edu.cn/info/1204/3256.htm) in [his lab](https://smart3d.tongji.edu.cn/en/Home.htm) during my undergraduate studies(2021.12 - now). Initially, I assisted his graduate students on Web3D lightweight visualization. However, driven by my passion for rendering, I later independently conducted a collaborative rendering project under his guidance. Our results were eventually published in [CCF CAD/Graphics 2023](https://dmcv.sjtu.edu.cn/cadgraphics2023/).

In the past, I had a keen interest in programming competitions and participated in the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/no2newbie) contest, where I achieved a rating of 1777(<font color=Blue>expert</font>) at my peak.

## Interests

During my high school years, I was fascinated by anime-style videos made with [MMD](https://learnmmd.com/what-is-mikumikudance/)(MikuMikuDance). I wanted to make these virtual characters as vivid and realistic as possible. This led me to delve into computer graphics at university. As I learned more about computer graphics, I gradually realized that physics simulation and light transport are the core of rendering photorealistic graphics. Consequently, I chose rendering as my direction for further research.
